# Homework 05


You are given two lists:

    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 200]
    b = [23, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9]

Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are
common between the lists (no duplicates). Your program should work on two list
of different sizes.

Extra: Randomly generate two lists to test your solution.
