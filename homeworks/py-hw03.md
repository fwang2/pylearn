You are given a list of arbitrary length:

    a = [3, 6, 9, 10, 2, 100, 28, 92, 23, 11]

Write a function `extract`, which takes two parameters. The first parameter is
the list of numbers, the second parameter p2 is a number. The function returns a
list with all the numbers that is less than p2.

For example:

    result = extract(a, 10)
    result --> [3, 6, 9, 2]
