# Homework 

This homework helps you to understand how a function can return multiple return
values. You are asked to write a function named `max_min`:

* input is a list of numbers
* output is the max and min of those numbers.

## Example:

    alist = [13, 231, -1, 3, 8]
    max, min = max_min(alist)
    print("max = ", max) 
    print("min = ", min)

The output should be:

    max = 231
    min = -1
